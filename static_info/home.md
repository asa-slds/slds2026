#### About SLDS Conference

The SLDS Conference is the flagship event of the ASA Section on
Statistical Learning and Data Science (SLDS). Started in 2016 and
scheduled biannually, it was interrupoted by the COVID-19 pandemic but
resumed in 2024. 


The main goal of the conference is to bring together researchers in statistical 
machine learning and artificial intelligence from academia, industry, and 
government in a relaxed and stimulating atmosphere to focus on the development 
of statistical learning theory, methods and applications.


Topics include, but are not limited to high dimensional statistics, 
big data analytics, deep learning, causal inference, graphical models, 
learning theory, model selection, network analysis, text and image analytics, 
spatiotemporal modeling and their applications in the health, social and 
engineering sciences, and signal and image processing.


This conference is mainly sponsored by the ASA section on Statistical Learning and 
Data Science. See our [sponsor page](sponsors.html) for a full list of our sponsors.
